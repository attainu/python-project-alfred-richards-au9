Maze Solver
Introduction:
● Maze solver is based on algorithm where the inputs are given in 1’s
and 0’s.The algorithm is designed to know the shortest path to reach
the destination point from source point.
Motivation:
● Maze puzzles are fine to solve and they get tricky when the size gets
bigger and bigger
● In order to find the shortest and fastest path for the designed maze.I
have created my ‘Maze solver algorithm’ using Python tool
● Algorithm link:

Some Sample Code
● Input file contains data like this:
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1
● Where 0 is all the blocked paths and 1 is all the paths that
you can go to. Now your task is to go through any 1 possible
path and give it in the output file. You have to mark all the
points you have visited while traversing your path as 1. So,
the output file will contain:
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1
Python Packages & Libraries Used:
● Python tool
